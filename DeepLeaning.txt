1. OVERVIEW OF DEEP LEARNING :-
Deep learning is a subset of machine learning.
It is capable of learning complex patterns and relationships within the data.
IT works on the basis of ANN.
ANN --> Aritificial Neural Network based on Biological Neural Network.

2. DEEP LEARNING V/S MACHINE LEARNING :- 
uses ANN for learning                     |  apply statistical algo for learning          
can work on the smaller amount of dataset |  requires the larger volumn of dataset
suitable of low-label task                |  suitable of complex task
take less time to train the model         |  take more time to train the model

3. BIOLOGICAL NEURON --> It is a tiny worker in human brain that helps them to think and process information.
These tiny worker make neuron network if grouped together.
New born baby brain is capable of learning new things easily.

4. ARCHITECTURE OF ANN :-
a. Input layer --> takes input , only 1 layer
b. Hidden layers --> inermediate, processes the input , have multiple layer (hyper-parameters)
c. Output layer --> generates output , only 1 layer
Hidden layers have full connected funtionality means that each hidden layer takes all the input.

ANN Training is divided into two parts --> Forward propogation and Backward propogation
w --> weight
b --> bais 
w and b are initialized randomly in starting.
Activation functions ---> ex. sigmoid.
z is passes by activation functions.
loss --> error
